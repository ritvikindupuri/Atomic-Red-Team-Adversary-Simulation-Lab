# Atomic Red Team Simulation Lab

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates **MITRE ATT&CK adversary techniques** in a secure Windows 10 lab using [Atomic Red Team (ART)](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and PowerShell.  
The goal was to safely replicate real-world attacker behaviors and practice Red Team tradecraft in a controlled environment.

## 🎯 Key Techniques
- **T1553.005 – ISO Payload Execution**  
- **T1016 – Network Configuration Discovery & Egress Port Enumeration**

*Figure 1: Combined output of MITRE ATT&CK T1016 modules — left panel shows network configuration discovery commands, right panel shows PowerShell logic for egress port enumeration and open-port results. This demonstrates how ATT&CK techniques were automated and operationalized using custom scripting.*
